		<h1>Content Strategy</h1>
		<p>
			On my personal website, I am going to put a full description of who i am, what i do,
			what i know, what my plans for the future are, and how I'm going to achieve them. It
			will feature pictures of me being me, doing volunteer work, and me doing things that require
			a lot of responsibility, so, I may look like a regular functioning adult. The site will also
			feature my successes in web development, and showcase my abilities so employers will know
			exactly what I'm capable of, right off the bat. I plan to have all my skills immediately visible
			so that anyone who comes across it will know that I know what I'm doing (somewhat). Though my theme
			may be dark, the important information will be highlighted in red so that whomever comes across my
			site will distinctly remember the most important and beneficial skills that might be detrimental to what they
			could use me for. Links to my resume and to my social media accounts will be present at the top of the page.
