	<h1>Persona</h1>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Name:</strong> Mac Johnson </li>
			<li><strong>Age:</strong> 45</li>
			<li><strong>Occupation:</strong> Founder of 4 small businesses, all related to technology. one is a store for computer parts, another
			is a local software development company, and the last two are store that buy, sell, and trade video games and accessories.
			</li>
			<li><strong>Issues:</strong> long pages, small lettering, to many colors or distracting buttons, slow loading, inaccurate search results,
			not being able to easily share a post with friends, and sloppy content placement.
			</li>
			<li><strong>Tech:</strong> uses a mac book pro, but still has an Samsung Galaxy s4. Plays games on his Playstation 4, but sometimes enjoys to play steam on his alienware desktop</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Mac Johnson is a single man, living in a one room apartment, specifically for the reason of saving money. he is a lover of all things
			technological, and devotes his life to software development. He is currently searching for a web developer that is familiar with MySql,
			PHP, Javascript, and Java. and the position he is looking to fill has to do with overseeing the websites for 2 of his 4 small businesses.
			he has issues with staring at a screen for long periods of time, so having a young, fresh out of college student to look over half of the
			sites for his businesses makes managing the establishments easier on his part.
