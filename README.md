## Milestone 1 Feedback
There are many corrections that need to be made to this project before it can pass. There are technical problems and changes that need to be made to purpose/audience/goal/persona as well.

**I want to give you until Monday 10/23 (8:00 am) to get everything fixed. Any later than that and you run the risk of falling behind.**

First things first - Completely read the [Milestone 1 Documentation](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/milestone-one/). If you have any questions on the instructions please send me a Slack message. **It's important that all the instructions are followed precisely.**

The following need to be corrected:
- Directory structure and file names need to be fixed. Follow the instructions in the documentation.
- Purpose/Audience/Goal need to be improved - see below.
- Persona needs to be redone - see below.

Remember that I created some [Sample PWP Milestones](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/example/). These should give you a good idea of the kind of work we are looking for. We are looking for professional-level work - something that you would consider professional enough to hand to a technical lead or to a client. **Do not copy from the sample milestones**. Use it as a guide only.

#### Purpose
Add more detail to your purpose. What is the purpose for your PWP in detail? Are you looking for clients for freelance work? Will you be looking for an internship or an entry-level web developer job? Or something else entirely?

#### Audience
This should have more detail, and be more professional. Be more specific. What kinds of clients are you looking for?

#### Goal
Just like the above - it could be more specific and more professional.

#### Persona
This section needs the most work. This should not be written like a dialogue, but should be similar to the persona in the [Sample Milestones](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/example/). The Persona should contain a name (hypothetical), demographic information, the persona's needs and goals, technology used, etc. For more information on creating personas, read: 
- [Milestone 1 Documentation](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/milestone-one/)
- [Sample Milestones](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/example/)
- https://www.webcredible.com/blog/personas-definitive-guide/.

#### Code Corrections
- HTML is indented incorrectly - really be careful about this.
- line 29 - **always** use the `alt` attribute on images.
- In your .gitignore, line 1 should be `.DS_Store`, line 2 should be `/.idea` and add `/vendor` to line 3
- Nice work on adding some CSS - we'll begin to cover this next week!

 Unfortunately I can't pass your Milestone 1 until everything is fixed. **Please have the changes done by Monday, October 23rd**, and Slack me if you have any questions or concerns.
