<h1>Personal Website</h1>

		<h2>Audience</h2>
		<p>The audience of this web-page are going to be primarily professional individuals, searching for people looking into web
		development and I.T. related positions. other people i am targeting as an audience are small business owners with a growing business,
			company employers with a high reputation in the tech industry, and simply, my own peers.
		</p>
		<h2>Goal</h2>
		<p>The goal of this website is to give employers a way to view my professional profile,
			and to contacted me if the decide to present me with an open position , and opportunities to further my education in web design and security. </p>
	<h1>Persona</h1>
		<p>"My name is Mac Johnson, I'm 34 and a recruiter for a web development and software company.
			Unfortunately it took me a while to find this page, but I did find it in a generally reasonable amount of time.
			I've been having a lot of issues with peoples personal websites being somewhat difficult to find, and
			even when I do, their content placement is horrid. It's sad, to say rhe least, that I have to go through
			that much effort to locate a website, then be presented with the work of a coder with minor experience.
			I cant say its helps me believe someone cares about their jobs, much less a worth being an employee at our
			company. What I'm looking for is someone who has some good experience with many coding languages such as, java,
			javascript,HTML, and any other language that has to do with web development is a plus.  I hope to use your
			site to decide whether or not you're a good choice for our company, and if you do work out then I have an idea
			of what kind of people I'm looking for to create and run a new department at our company.
